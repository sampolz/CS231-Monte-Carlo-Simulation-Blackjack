# CS231: Monte Carlo Simulation Blackjack

A blackjack simulator in Java

This was my first project for CS231 - Data Structures and Algorithms. The program simulated blackjack games by creating a dealer and player and dealing them both random cards until somebody won. This project was mainly about learning java.
